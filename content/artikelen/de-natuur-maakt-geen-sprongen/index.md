_"Natura non facit saltus"_, ofwel, de natuur maakt geen sprongen. An axiom in the works of Gottfried Leibniz,[^1] one of the inventors of the infinitesimal calculus. It is also an essential element of Charles Darwin's treatment of natural selection.[^2] The principle expresses the idea that natural things and properties change gradually, rather than suddenly. In a mathematical context, this allows one to assume that the solutions of the governing equations are continuous, and also does not preclude their being differentiable (differentiability implies continuity). What does this principle exactly mean, what are its consequences, and how can it be used and abused?

### The principle

According to Guenon, whole number is essentialy discontinuous, and this is what one might properly call 'pure quanitity'[^3][^4]. Discontinuois is her to mean that there ar in fact leaps, from one to two, from two to three, and so on. The discontinuous is that which makes no leaps. spatial and temporal magnidtues are continuous; in the case of geometric magnitudes one is always able to take from them elements as small as one likes, infinitesimal quantities. The circle has in indefinite amount of 'corners', the geometric line can be halved until indefinitude. From this arise interesting "paradoxes", for example as the Coastline paradox, or Zeno's paradoxes such as the achilles and the tortoise.
