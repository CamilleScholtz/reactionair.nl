"You are not allowed to make that comparison!", we hear this platitute a lot lately. But what does it imply? Let us start with definitions. A 'vergelijking' is defined as 'TODO', this is quite different from saying that something is identical, which is defined as 'TODO'. 'relativating the holocaust!', another such platitue, here 'relativating' means.

We know the world though comparisons and relations, in fact I would go as far as saying that there is nothing without relations. We know the meaning of the term 'blue' by relating various sensual experiences of looking at 'blue' things, such as the sky, comparing them. We know about the present by relating and comparing it to the past. If there was no context, no relations, no past, we would nothing. Enough with the abstractions and philosophy, now on to the tangible and clear example: corona.


### Comparisons and corona

Comparisons with the Second World War are nothing new of course, we heard pretty much nothing else the past 70 years. "Being against mass-migration is bad, because hitler was also a nationalist, and see what that resulted in?", "You don't like post-modern architecture and art, you know who else didn't like this? Hitler.", "You believe that a stable society has a dominant culture? Nazi.". We could go on an on. I could probably list a dozen of real life examples with sources, but we all know what I am talking about, and frankly, I am too lazy too collect them.

Never did we hear any "jewish organizations" about these comparisons, in fact, these organizations were often at the forefront of these very comparisons. In the case of american politics a whole book has been written about this, 'The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering ' by the jewish author Norman Finkelstein. In this book the author argues that the American Jewish establishment exploits the memory of the Nazi Holocaust for political and financial gain, as well as to further the interests of Israel.

To relate this back to the Netherlands, when I recommended this well-sourced book on my Twitter, the so-called "Centrum Informatie en Documentatie Israel" (CIDI) created a page about me on their website. Now when you google my name the very first result is this webpage, with a screenshot of the tweet, which was used on their article 'Twitter als motor voor modern antisemitisme'.

Like we said before, "jewish organizations", are often at the forefront of these comparisons, just to make it clear and give some examples:

* _Anne Frank Stichting_:

  >_"De bestaande angstgevoelens, gekoppeld aan een sterke behoefte aan zekerheid, wordt door extreem-nationalistische partijen geexploiteerd. [...] Door vluchtelingen, asielzoekers en migranten aan te wijzen als zondebok, worden zij verantwoordelijk gesteld voor alles wat in de samenleving niet goed gaat. Dat door hun aanwezigheid het land ten onder gaat. [...] Het is volgens de Anne Frank Stichting noodzakelijk de herinnering aan het fascisme in de Tweede Wereldoorlog levend te houden."_

  The implication here being that "extreem nationalist parties" will cause a second holocaust?

* _Centrum Informatie en Documentatie Israel_:

  >_"Wat begon met het uitsluiten van Joden uit een studentenvereniging of het niet kopen van zadels, leidde tot de grootste massamoord aller tijden",._
