In a recent 'debate' in the Second Chamber, Freek Jansen argued against mass-migration and the replacement of the native dutch population. This essay is not about the hard numbers (though they do support his position), but more about the classification of "dutch people". It was quite clear that when Jansen spoke about the dutch, he is not only reffering to a piece of paper, a bearocratic statement, but something more.

Let us start out with definitions. I would classify Jansen as a nationalist. Nation, etymologically, comes from the latin nation, meaning born. The dictionary definies naiton as "a large body of people united by common descent, history, culture, or language, inhabiting a particular country or territory". In both we see that nation is way more than a piece of paper. A nation stretches back in history, builds upon that fundament.

In the debate, and in many other debates I have seen, the argument quickly dissolves into a kind of relativism. "What is dutch culture?", "What is a dutch person?", "My mother is born is in germany, am I dutch?". Because nationality, and more specifically ethnicity, is a spectrum, it seems that it doesn't exist. But is this valid? Let us take the example of color. Color is a spectrum, and there are an indefite amount of colors. What we call red is actually just a construct, because when does a shade of "orange" become yellow, or when does it become red? There are no hard borders between colors, just as there are no hard borders between ethinicties, there are only gradations. Yet we knowwhat red is, we know what blue is, we know what a dutch person is, and we know what a somalian person is. We know that orange is closer to yellow than it is to blue, and we know that a german is closer to a dutch person than a somalian.
