Often when debating about a topic with left wing people, it quickly dissolves into a kind of relativism, or what I call 'the abstraction fallacy'. Topics can range form anything, from immigration to art and beauty.

Let us first start out with relativism and abstraction. It is quite easy to be 'sekptical' and dissolve everything and nothing into absuridy. Ultimatly we are all startdust, so nothing matter. Age is just an arbirtray amount of rotations around the sun. Borders are just arbirary lines drawn on the sand. Gender is a social construct. Good and bad are social construct. Nothing matters! Well, we can't really live like this, now can we?

Let us take the example of an argument about immigration. In no time the abstraction fallacies fly you arround the ears: "What even is is a dutch person?", "Well, what even is dutch culture?" "My mother is born is in germany, am I dutch?". Truth it, yes, nationality and ethnicity are a spectrum without clear borders, as is pretty much anything in life. Culture indeed is a 'social construct', whatever that might mean.

 Yet color is also is also a spectrum: there are an indefite amount of colors  What we call red is actually just a construct, because when does a shade of "orange" become yellow, or when does it become red? There are no hard borders between colors, just as there are no hard borders between nationalities or people, there are only gradations. Yet we kno what red is, we know what blue is, just like we know what a dutch person is, and like we know what a japanese person is. We know that orange is closer to yellow than it is to blue, and we know that a german is closer to a dutch person than a japanese.
