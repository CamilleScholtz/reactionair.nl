Laten we ze geen aandacht geven maar eenmalig een blik toewerpen en voorwaarts gaan. \n\nAnd I—my head oppressed by horror—said:\n“Master, what is it that I hear? Who are\nthose people so defeated by their pain?”\n\nAnd he to me: “This miserable way\nis taken by the sorry souls of those\nwho lived without disgrace and without praise.\n\nThey now commingle with the coward angels,\nthe company of those who were not rebels\nnor faithful to their God, but stood apart.\n\nThe heavens, that their beauty not be lessened,\nhave cast them out, nor will deep Hell receive them—\neven the wicked cannot glory in them.”\n\nAnd I: “What is it, master, that oppresses\nthese souls, compelling them to wail so loud?”\nHe answered: “I shall tell you in few words.\n\nThose who are here can place no hope in death,\nand their blind life is so abject that they\nare envious of every other fate.\n\nThe world will let no fame of theirs endure;\nboth justice and compassion must disdain them;\nlet us not talk of them, but look and pass.”\n\n- Dante - Inferno III"
